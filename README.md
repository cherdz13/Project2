# My Community in Lyrics
By: Chelsea Hernandez
# Project Overview
Everyone has a different representation of community. Some see it within neighborhoods,ethnicity, or having similar interests. To me community is a representation of people who care for you. Who stand with you through the best and worst times; with or without blood relations. A song called Disfruto by Carla Morrison fully captivates my idea of community.

# technical overview
There will be seven lines of lyrics from Morrison's song "Disfruto". Each line is a emotion or moment that is commonly experienced in everyday life. Each line of lyrics will placed in different formats between three pages.
In each page the lyrics will be animated in a typewriter like format. The first page holds three lyrics on the left side of the page. The second page holds two lines of lyrics, all three words displayed into a stair like form. The third page holds the last two lines, one line in the upper left side. While the second line will be centered in the page. Key words and transitions will be underlined and written in cursive. The song is in spanish and for condsideration of non-spanish speakers. Tere will be small translations under the original lyrics.
